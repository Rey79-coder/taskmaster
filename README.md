<!--  - SELF NOTE FOR THE PROJECT PROCESS
       - add functionality
- As a paid developer. I should proceed every project by following the next steps.

1. Create a local project.
2. Save a copy in a remote repository.
3. Rename master to main branch and add two more. 

       - Develop branch will merge in "feature-branches".
       - feature/edit-task will hold all the newest code.


After you did the setup is a good practice to outline what you are doing. 

Github issues can help you keeping updated where you're at in your webpage. -->
