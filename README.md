# taskmaster - add functionality

- As a paid developer. I should proceed every project by folliwing the next steps.

1. Create a local project.
2. Save a copy in a remote repository.
3. Rename master to main branch and add two more. 

       - Develop branch will merge in "feature-branches".
       - feature/edit-task will hold all the newest code.


After you did the setup is a good practice to outline what you are doing. 
Github issues can help you keeping updated where you're at in your webpage.
